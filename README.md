# Web Development Repository

Welcome to the Web Development Repository! This repository is designed to help you track your progress and showcase your projects as you learn web development through Angela Yu's Web Development Bootcamp. Whether you're a beginner or have some coding experience, this repository will be your companion throughout your learning journey.

## Getting Started

Before diving into this repository, make sure you have the following:

- Basic understanding of web development concepts
- Angela Yu's Web Development Bootcamp course materials
- A code editor (such as Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or any other editor of your choice)

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized as follows:

```
/
├── lessons/
│   ├── lesson1/
│   ├── lesson2/
│   ├── ...
│   └── lessonN/
└── projects/
    ├── project1/
    ├── project2/
    ├── ...
    └── projectN/
```

- The `lessons` directory contains subdirectories for each lesson in the bootcamp. These directories will help you store code snippets, notes, and any other relevant materials from the lessons.
- The `projects` directory is where you'll upload your projects. Each project will have its own directory, named `projectX`, where `X` represents the project number.

## How to Use

Follow these steps to make the most out of this repository:

1. Start by creating a new directory inside the `projects` folder for your first project. Name it `projectX`, where `X` is the project number.
2. After completing a lesson, go through the lesson materials and exercises, and then start working on the corresponding project.
3. As you progress through the project, update the files within the project directory with your code, documentation, and any other resources that you find helpful.
4. It's important to commit your changes regularly. Commits are like saving checkpoints of your progress. Be sure to write descriptive commit messages that reflect the work you've done or any challenges you faced.
5. Push your changes to the remote repository at the end of each day or whenever you feel you've accomplished a significant portion of the project.
6. Repeat steps 1-5 for each new lesson and project.

## Collaboration

Feel free to collaborate with other bootcamp students by sharing your projects, asking questions, and providing feedback. You can use the repository's issue tracker and pull requests to discuss specific topics, ask for help, or suggest improvements.
